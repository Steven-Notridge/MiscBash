# MiscBash


I'm just going to use this as a place to store random scripts that I need for Linux stuff. Mostly HomeLab and unlikely anything Production level. 


### Inital-Config
This script is just to install the basic tools I use, on a fresh install. It's a pain doing these things manually everytime! And yes, `NOPASSWD: ALL` is not a good idea, but this is my homelab and only I have access to it. Do not use this in production.
